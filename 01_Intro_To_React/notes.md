# Intro To React Notes

## Part A

### Creating a new React app

Using Vite is the easiest way to create a react app:
```bash
npm create vite@latest directory_name -- --template react
```

Then install dependancies and run the project on localhost:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Delete boilerplate code:
- `assets` directory
- `App.css`
- `index.css`

And delete the imports of those files in the `main.jsx` file.

**When developing, always keep DevTools open, at all times**
